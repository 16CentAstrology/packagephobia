- ‚öñÔ∏è Find the cost of adding a new dev dependency to your project
- üïó Save yourself time and disk space with this web app

## What is the purpose?

Package Phobia reports the size of an npm package *before* you install it.

This is useful for inspecting potential `devDependencies` without using up precious disk space or waiting minutes for `npm install`. Ain't nobody got time for dat.

## [Demo](https://packagephobia.now.sh)

A good use case might be comparing test runners, web frameworks, or even bundlers. Click one of the links below to see Package Phobia in action!

## Prior Art

Package Phobia is inspired by [Bundle Phobia](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia) and [Cost Of Modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules).

## How is this different?

- [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh) reports the install size of a package.
- [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com) reports the size after webpack bundles the package.
- [Cost Of Modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules) reports the size of your currently installed packages.

## What are the long term goals?

Ideally, this information could be listed on npmjs.com, npms.io, or bundlephobia.com.

Below are the relevant feature requests for each website.

- [GitHub issue for bundlephobia.com](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia/issues/40)
- [GitHub issue for npmjs.com](https://github.com/npm/www/issues/197)
- [GitHub issue for npms.io](https://github.com/npms-io/npms-www/issues/219)
- [GitHub issue for staticgen.com](https://github.com/netlify/staticgen/issues/359)
- [GitHub issue for cost-of-modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules/issues/50)

Hopefully, this would lead to publishers taking notice of their bloated packages such as the following:

- [micro is not micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro/issues/234)
- [ava is not minimal](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/1622)
- [typescript has doubled in size since v2.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23339)
- [bundlesize is 10x larger after npm install since v0.14.0](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/213)

## npm dependencies in the media

I'm not the first one to notice npm packages are snowballing into bloated dependencies of dependencies.
