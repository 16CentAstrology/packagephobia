## What is the purpose?

Package Phobia reports the size of an npm package *before* you install it.

This is useful for inspecting potential `devDependencies` without using up precious disk space or waiting minutes for `npm install`. Ain't nobody got time for dat.

Results are saved so the first person might wait a bit to view package size, but everyone else gets to see the results instantly!

## Prior Art

Package Phobia is inspired by [Bundle Phobia](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia) and [Cost Of Modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules).

## How is this different?

- [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh) reports the install size of a package.
- [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com) reports the size after webpack bundles the package.
- [Cost Of Modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules) reports the size of your currently installed packages.
- [Badge Size](https://github.com/ngryman/badge-size) reports the gzip size of a single file from a package.
- [Bundle Size](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize) fails CI if a file's size is too large.
- [Package Size](https://github.com/egoist/package-size) compares the bundle size of multiple packages
- [Require So Slow](https://github.com/ofrobots/require-so-slow) traces the time of each `require` module in a node.js app.
- [Why Bundled?](https://github.com/d4rkr00t/whybundled) uses webpack stats to show your number of imports and package size.
- [Do you even lift?](https://github.com/npm/do-you-even-lift) - *NEW* reports size after rollup bundles the package.

## What are the long term goals?

Ideally, this information could be listed on npmjs.com, npms.io, or bundlephobia.com.

Below are the relevant feature requests for each website.

- [GitHub issue for bundlephobia.com](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia/issues/40)
- [GitHub issue for npmjs.com](https://github.com/npm/www/issues/197)
- [GitHub issue for npms.io](https://github.com/npms-io/npms-www/issues/219)
- [GitHub issue for staticgen.com](https://github.com/netlify/staticgen/issues/359)
- [GitHub issue for cost-of-modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules/issues/50)
- [GitHub issue for npm-cli](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20427)

Hopefully, this would lead to publishers taking notice of their bloated packages such as the following:

- [micro is not micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro/issues/234)
- [ava is not minimal](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/1622)
- [typescript has doubled in size since v2.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23339)
- [bundlesize is 10x larger after npm install since v0.14.0](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/213)

## npm dependencies in the media

I'm not the first one to notice npm packages are snowballing into bloated dependencies of dependencies.
